## Features

- Automatically increases max carry weight when the player has a backpack
- Supports different backpack tiers (e.g., standard and casino backpack)
- Works on player login and whenever the event is manually triggered
- Easy integration with existing ESX inventory systems

---

## Requirements

- [ESX Legacy](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy)
- Inventory system that supports `setMaxWeight()` (e.g. `ox_inventory` or `esx_inventory`)
